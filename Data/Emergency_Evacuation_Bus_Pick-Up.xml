Revisions:
Date:  August 14th, 2019        By:  Josh Brashears
Reason:  Implemented USPS standards to all addresses.  Changed the values in the CITY field from municipality names to USPS mailing cities.  Added two new fields:  MUNICID (Text 2) and MUNICIPALITY (Text 25).  Populated these two new fields from MDC.Municipality_poly.

Date:  July, 2019        By:  Soheila Ajabshir
Reason:  Implemented COM standards to all addresses.

Date: April 2018                By: B. Oung
Reason: Added the following fields: Active, PickupFreq, RouteNo, CreatedBy, CreatedDate, ModifyBy, ModifyDate and GlobalID to accommadate Commission Cava's resolution and for editing and replication purposes. Domains were created. 

Date:  May 16, 2016         By:  Josh Brashears
Reason:  Received confirmation from Transit regarding changes to seven names and/or addresses.  This update only includes these seven changes and does not comprise the full 2016 hurricane season update.  The complete and final update is pending Transit's check of all the signs and publication of the official list.

The seven changes are:

     THE COVE CONDIMINIUM COMMUNITY, 21163 SW 85TH AVE 
     SOUTH DADE CAMP, 13400 SW 312TH ST 
     MIAMI-DADE COLLEGE, 11011 SW 104TH ST 
     COUNCIL TOWERS SOUTH, 599 COLLINS AVE 
     STREET LOCATION, 908 ALTON RD 
     STREET LOCATION, 1965 ALTON RD 
     WILLIAM F. DICKINSON COMMUNITY CENTER, 29 NE 16TH ST

Date:  July 15, 2015         By:  Ivonne Rodriguez
Reason:  2015 Hurricane Season update.

Revisions:
Date:  June 13, 2014        By:  Josh Brashears
Reason:  2014 Hurricane Season update.  Some names and addresses were changed, with Transit’s input.  Some signs were re-positioned and/or corrected.  More positional corrections are pending and may be implemented before next hurricane season.

Date: April 2014                 By: S. Ajabshir
Reason: Made corrections to some attribute in Evacation Zone field.

Date: March 2014               By: Maribel Valderrama
Reason: Populated the IDs, LAT/LON, X_COORD and Y_COORD  for LARRY/ PENNY THOMPSON PARK, MIAMI DADE COLLEGE, WEST KENDALL TRANSIT TERMINAL, DADELAND NORTH METRORAIL STATION, CORAL REEF PARK AND RIDE LOT, and LANDMARK MOBILE HOME PARK. 

Date: June 2013                  By: V. Calle
Reason: The changes that were made were the location of five of the points, I updated the addresses for 12 locations, changed the names for 8 locations and added 6 new bus stops.

Date: August 2012               By: S. Ajabshir,
Reason: To move the bus stop for GATOR PARK MHP to its correct location.

Date: July 2010                   By: S. Ajabshir, C. Hall &amp; N. Alvarez
Reason: Assisted DEM with annual hurricane update. Deleted  Landmark Mobile Home park and removed name of  closed mobile homes.  As per DEM Miami-Everglades KampGround at 20675 SW 162nd Ave and Larry/Penny Thompson at 12451 SW 184th St., do not need bus stops.

Date: June 2008                By: Soheila Ajabshir &amp; Craig Hall (DEM&amp;HS)
Blue Lake Mobile Home Park was removed.  Leisure East MHP was renamed to Palm Garden. Sun Haven Trailer Park does not exist, but the sign is used for Coe's Trailer Court and Dixie Trailer Park in close proximity.

Reason: Annual Hurricane update. Total of about 70 points were re-aligned to actual bus stop.

Date: October 2006            By: GIS Technical Support Staff
Reason: The data was converted from the legacy coverage format to the ArcGIS Geodatabase feature class format.

Date:   June 2006                     By: N. Alvarez
Reason: Yearly update. Six hurricane evacuation bus stops added.

Date:   July 2005                     By: J. Ruiz
Reason: Received updated from OEM. Five bus stops were removed and some were aligned.

Date:   Sept. 2004                    By: N. Alvarez
